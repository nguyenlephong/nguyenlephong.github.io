## Summary

Bachelor's degree in Information Technology (minor in Software Engineering, **GPA 3.36**) with **7+ years of experience** in full-stack software development, including **2+ years** contributing to technical leadership, architectural decision-making, and delivery coordination across teams.

Hands-on experience in designing, building, and operating end-to-end systems — from front-end applications and backend services to CI/CD pipelines, release workflows, and production infrastructure — with a strong emphasis on automation, operational clarity, and reliable delivery.

*Here are my recent focused hard skills over the past few years:*

- **Backend**: Strong hands-on experience with **Node.js**; designing REST/GraphQL APIs with clear contracts, authentication and encryption mechanisms, backward compatibility, and resilience for enterprise and third-party integrations.

- **Databases**: Deep practical experience with **MySQL**, focusing on schema and data-model design, indexing strategies, query optimization, transaction boundaries, migration planning, and consistency trade-offs in distributed and high-throughput systems.

- **Frontend**: Solid experience building and maintaining complex client applications using **React** (TypeScript, Next.js), **React Native**, and **Micro-Frontend** architectures; applying performance optimization, state management, and scalable UI patterns.

- **Infrastructure & Platform Engineering**: Hands-on with **Docker** and **Kubernetes** across multiple environments; experience operating managed clusters (**FKE**, **AKS**, **EKS**), GitOps-based deployments with **ArgoCD**, CI/CD pipelines, and domain/SSL management.

- **Architecture & Delivery Practices**: Experience applying Micro-Frontend and multi-tenant architectures, feature-flag-driven rollouts, progressive delivery strategies, and observability practices to support safe releases and production diagnostics.

- **Testing & Quality Engineering**: Practical use of Jest, Cucumber, Puppeteer, and Testing Library to ensure regression safety, release confidence, and production readiness across services and applications.

## Work Experiences

### Senior Software Engineer Lead
**NDSVN — Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam**  
*Aug. 2025 – Present*

Owned product delivery and technical direction post-CTO transition, leading architecture decisions, rollout systems, enterprise-grade integrations, and cross-team alignment while managing a delivery team of **8 developers (including 4 seniors)** and **3 QC engineers**.

#### Technical Impact & System Scale

- Engineered a **.NET Core multi-tenant feature flag system** (**30+ tenants, ~40k users**) with a priority-based rule engine, percentage rollout (tenant/segment/env), JSON-config values, and stateless runtime evaluation — powering mobile/web apps and enabling controlled, progressive production releases across high-traffic tenants.

- Built secure integrations with **Gtel & Napas**: RSA-4096 handshake, AES-256 payload encryption, **mTLS** mutual authentication, certificate pinning, retry queues, idempotent API contracts, and ACK-driven monitoring for unstable third-party services.

- Implemented **Micro-Frontend** architecture (Angular host + React modules), enabling independent deploy cycles and feature isolation — reducing regression surface and deployment coupling across teams.

- Introduced an observability stack (PostHog + metrics pipeline + workflows) for rollout impact tracking, feature adoption analysis, anomaly detection, and regression tracing — significantly cutting debugging and analysis time across release cycles.

- Assumed ownership of inherited infrastructure and kept the organization moving — quietly absorbing production fires, pipeline failures, cluster quirks, and integration instability so teams never stalled; shaping **ArgoCD**, **CI/CD**, **domains/SSL**, and **AKS/FKE/QTSC/EKS** clusters into systems that are **diagnosable, recoverable, and stable instead of recurring unknowns**.

#### AI-driven Productivity

- Built **AI agents** supporting code review, deployment assistance, service-quota validation, API health monitoring, and release analysis — shortening decision and delivery loops across product teams.

- Developed integration simulations and sandbox/demo modules to handle unstable partners and secure pre-contract technical validation within third-party ecosystems.

#### Leadership & Team Enablement

- **Re-structured the engineering organization** after leadership transition: defined org chart, competency matrix, workload routing, and ownership boundaries — unlocking autonomy and reducing lead-time on technical decisions.

- Established a unified engineering playbook: branch strategy, commit conventions, release tagging, rollout criteria, API/integration rules, and a technical specification repository (RFCs, runbooks, troubleshooting guides).

- Led hiring and capability growth loops: structured interviews (QC/Fullstack), onboarding paths, 1:1 coaching, performance review cycles, and cross-team conflict resolution to keep delivery collaborative and output-focused.

- Maintained delivery quality through a documentation-first culture and process guardrails (checklists, handover rules, rollback readiness), ensuring predictable release cadence during scaling phases.
